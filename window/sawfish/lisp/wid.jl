;; Assigns to windows short ids (wids) (from the sequence
;; 0,1,2,..,9,a,b,...,z,36,37,...)  and provides shortcuts to switch to
;; particular window by one key-stroke.

;; INSTALLATION:
;; Put this file into load-path and add (load "wid") to .sawfishrc
;;
;; After installation window titles will be pefixed with string of the form
;; "<wid>| ". To switch to the window with id <wid>, press Hyper-<wid>.
;;
;; CONFIGURATION:
;; By default, this module binds its short-cuts to the Hyper-prefixed
;; keystrokes. If you want to use Hyper and Super modifiers on PC keyboard
;; with Microsoft keys, add something like this to your .xmodmap file:
;; 
;; ! for pc-keyboard with `Windows' keys
;; ! left key with MSWindows logo
;; keycode 115 = Hyper_L
;; ! right key with MSWindows logo
;; keycode 116 = Hyper_R
;; ! local menu
;; keycode 117 = Super_R
;;
;; wid-widability-hook is used to select which windows should be decorated
;; with wids. Use something like this
;; 
;; (add-hook 'wid-widability-hook 
;;		  (lambda (win)
;;			(and (not (equal (aref (get-x-text-property win 'WM_CLASS) 1) 
;;							 "Panel"))
;;				 (not (equal (aref (get-x-text-property win 'WM_CLASS) 1) 
;;							 "Xrus")))))
;;
;; to skip Gnome panel, keyboard switcher, etc.
