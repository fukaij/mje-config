Description:

Options:

				# --help | -h * excludes=*

Arguments:
  <file> ...			List of files to edit
				# files += [1,*] file : file
EOF

#  # Loop through files individually rather than sending as one block - that way
#  # they all end up at the top of the buffer stack in Emacs, not all except one
#  # being on the bottom
#  local file
#  for file in $files
#  do
#    emacsclient --no-wait $file
#  done

# For now pass all in one go. Two problems with above, (i) it buggers up
# with clearcase files, (ii) it may be responsible for 'too many client'
# errors
emacsclient --no-wait $files
