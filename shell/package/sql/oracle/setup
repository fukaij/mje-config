# WARNING:

# This package has been ported from the old sql system. It has undergone no
# testing and probably isn't even complete yet.

# Query for owner may be useful:
# select owner from all_tables
# where (owner=(select distinct table_owner from user_synonyms)
# or owner=(select user from dual)) and rownum=1
